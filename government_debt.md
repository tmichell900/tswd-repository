# Visualizing Government Debt

## Recent Government Debt, Country Subset

Below is a graph of the G20 countries and their corresponding government debts in 2016:

## Government Debt Grid Lines, 1995 - 2019
The next visualization shows "grid of line chart," which separates out each country while maintaining the same scale for comparison. The number of countries and years were limited to prevent overcrowding.

## Updated Government Debt Visualization
Now that we have an idea of what the Debt-To-GDP ratio looks like for each country individually, let's compare them. The line chart below shows all of the countries' Debt-To-GDP ratios over time. The countries with the highest ratio are highlighted: Japan, Greece, and Italy. The U.S. is shown in blue as a reference. Estonia, the country in this group with the lowest ratio, is shown in black. This chart is interesting because it shows the change in time for the countries with the highest debt to GDP ratios. Decision makers in those countries could use these countries could use this visualization to encourage legislatures to enact measures to lower this ratio. Japan in particular has the highest increase in this metric since 1995. 

Decision makers in the United States on the other hand, could use this visualization to argue that although our Debt-To-GDP ratio is high, the relative change over time compared to other countries is low.

## A Visualization Compare and Contrast

There are three different visualizations shown above: a simple bar chart, a grid of line charts, and a single line chart. Each chart communicates something slightly different. The bar chart is good for comparing countries and building a picture for the hierarchy for a single year: Japan clearly has the highest ratio, while Russia has the lowest. This comparison can be made very quickly. 
The grid of line charts helps to show change over time for the countries individually. It is more difficult to compare countries to one another, particularly if they are further away from each other in the grid, but it's easy to tell that Japan and Ireland have had relatively volatile ratios, while Luxembourg has remained constant.
Finally, the single line chart is good for identifying trends among a handful of countries at a time. Having labels and different colors for all of the countries creates a busy, unreadable chart. However, highlighting just a few countries helps to show their trends as compared to the majority of other countries. I chose a highlighted line chart for the third visualization in order to be very clear about the take-away for the reader. There are a lot of years and countries, and by focusing on just a few, the visualization viewer can make conclusions more quickly. Two key aspects of what viewers see when looking at a data visualization are "we see first what stands out" and "we only see a few things at once" (2). Because there is a lot of information in this data set that could potentially be interesting, I chose to focus on asubet that the viewer could see at first glance.
