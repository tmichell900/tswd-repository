## Final Visualizations

To start, I wanted to experiment with a way to summarize the data with a comparison to states' locations geographically.

Below is the recreated visualization of the original. I opted to simplify the variables, and show more of the natural relationship between home age and average improvement project cost in that state.

Below is the visualization for the Pittsburgh area:
