# Critique by Design: A Look at Housing and Renovation Costs


## Inspirational Visualization and Critique

The original data visualization that inspired this project comes from Angi's "Economy of Everything Home" Report. Each year, Angi interviews its customers about home improvements done that year to get a picture of the home renovation trends for that year. The visualization below caught my attention because of the large amounts of data it is communicating for each state in a single visualization:

Based on the visualization and the method of critique established by Stephen Few, I rated the visualization according to 7 metrics as shown below:

The things about the visualization I would keep is the use of size and color. The visualization allows you to make snap judgements about the states that are highlighted such as the highest home values come from DC, California, and Hawaii. Older homes are concentrated on the East coast which is easy to tell because of both the colors and the positioning on the graph.

A few things that didn't work well are the use of red and green (not condusive to the color blind), the repetition of variables (home age is represnted on the x-axis as well as color), and the inclusion of Washington D.C. in the data. Although it is a state, it is a concentrated, urban area that will naturally have a higher rental rate than states with rural and urban areas. Therefore, I don't think the visualization benefits from including it. 

One of the main things I would change is the placement of variables. By putting home age on the x-axis and home ownership rate on the y-axis, the reader will want to draw correlations between the two (for example, as home age increases, home ownership rate decreases). However, this is not a meaningful statistic or relationship for people looking to buy a home. Therefore, the main areas of the visualization to change is the placement of variables to make it more perceptible to the reader, cleaning up the labeling and aesthetics to allow the reader to more easily draw conclusions, and only including relevant data that people would need to know when looking to buy or renovate a home in a particular area to increase the completeness of the visualization. 


## Sketches and Brainstorming

This is the first sketch:

This is the second sketch:

And this is a third sketch with information specific to Pittsburgh:

## Soliciting Feedback

I got feedback from my husband, my parents, and my friend (Kate Maffey, a veteran of TSWD). 

Here's what they had to say about the sketches ...

## Final Visualizations

To start, I wanted to experiment with a way to summarize the data with a comparison to states' locations geographically. To reduce the amount of data on the graph and to prime the reader for the visualizations that follow, I opted to just show median housing prices around the country. This allows the reader to draw comparisons within and between regions before adding complexities such as home age and home improvement costs.

Below is the recreated visualization of the original. I opted to simplify the variables, and show more of the natural relationship between home age and average improvement project cost in that state.
