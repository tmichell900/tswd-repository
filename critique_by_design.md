# Critique by Design: A Look at Housing and Renovation Costs


## Inspirational Visualization and Critique

The original data visualization that inspired this project comes from Angi's "Economy of Everything Home" Report. Each year, Angi interviews its customers about home improvements done that year to get a picture of the home renovation trends for that year. The visualization below caught my attention because of the large amounts of data it is communicating for each state in a single visualization:

## Sketches and Brainstorming

This is the first sketch:

And this is a third sketch with information specific to Pittsburgh:

## Soliciting Feedback

I got feedback from my husband, my parents, and my friend (Kate Maffey, a veteran of TSWD). 

Here's what they had to say about the sketches ...

## Final Visualizations

To start, I wanted to experiment with a way to summarize the data with a comparison to states' locations geographically. To reduce the amount of data on the graph and to prime the reader for the visualizations that follow, I opted to just show median housing prices around the country. This allows the reader to draw comparisons within and between regions before adding complexities such as home age and home improvement costs.

Below is the recreated visualization of the original. I opted to simplify the variables, and show more of the natural relationship between home age and average improvement project cost in that state.

Below is the visualization for the Pittsburgh area:
