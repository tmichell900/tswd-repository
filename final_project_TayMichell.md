# Navigating the Housing Market in Pittsburgh


As Pittsburgh increases in popularity as an AI hub for many corporations, recently graduated students may increasingly look at staying in Pittsburgh long-term.
Over the next few years, the Artificial Intelligence Integration Center (AI2C) in Pittsburgh will grow from employing 40 Army personnel to 400+.
While renting is typically the first choice of young professionals (particularly in a seller's market), there are significant financial and psychological benefits to investing in a home.
The following overview establishes a data-driven look at the real estate market in Pittsburgh, and what you need to know before investing in a home. 

## Outline
*Summary:*
When my husband and I first moved to Pittsburgh in June of 2020, it was difficult to know which neighborhood to live in and the nuances of home buying in the area. Based on what we've learned, the goal of this project is two-fold: inform about the current real estate trends in Pittsburgh (1) and give home owners and potential home buyers the tools to make informed decisions when it comes to renovations and updates (2). 

| **Setup** | We bought a house as a way to invest and have a good place to live. |
| ----- | ---------- |
| **Conflict** | We didn't know what we were doing, and renovations taught us many lessons. |
| **Resolution** | Here are some tools to inform your home buying / renovation journey. |

The project will be broken down into the following sections:
* Introduction
* National Real Estate
* National Renovations
* Pittsburgh Real Estate
* Pittsburgh Renovations
* What's Next?

Each of the sections are further explained in the Initial Sketches section below.


## Initial Sketches

#### OUTLINE
Many of the sketches are re-used visualizations from Homework 3, as the topic has remained constant with some tweaks and a more focused scope. 

*General Progression from the Reader's Perspective*
This is the first sketch from the in-class exercise. The 

#### INTRODUCTION

During the introduction, pictures of the house my husband and I bought will be included. Based on what some of the example presentations from class did, I will use these pictures of the house to build the color scheme for the rest of the presentation to keep the presentation coherent design-wise (see below).

#### NATIONAL REAL ESTATE

To capture national real estate data, I started with a map of median home prices across the states. This is a sketch that will likely be enabled for the final presentation to include a time element (which places have increased / decreased in median home price in the past few years).

#### NATIONAL RENOVATIONS

To capture national renovation data, the following sketch will be modified to best suit the story:

#### PITTSBURGH REAL ESTATE

Moving into Pittsburgh real estate, some kind of chloropleth map will indicate ____

#### PITTSBURGH RENOVATIONS



#### WHAT'S NEXT?

A custom quiz at the end of the visualization will help you to determine where to go next in your home-buying journey. Answer a set of quesitons, and you will get a customized result for buying, selling, or renovating based on the amount of money you have saved, how willing you are to do renovations yourself, what your current living situation is, and what you'd like to move to.

Additionally, there will be an itemized list of resources (similar to the TSWD Google Document) that you can go to if the reader knows what cateogry they fall into, and they want a list of pre-approved resources for home buying and renovating.

## The Data

The data for the project will come from four main sources, as shown in the table below:

| Topic | National Level | Pittsburgh |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Home Prices | Experien: [Median Home Value by State](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/research/median-home-values-by-state/) | Western PA Regional Data Center: [Allegheny County Property Sale Transactions](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/real-estate-sales) |
| Renovation Prices | Pro Remodeler: [Improvement Spending By State](https://www.proremodeler.com/improvement-spending-state) | Western PA Regional Data Center: [City of Pittsburgh Permit Summary](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-building-permit-summary) |

The national data was copied directly from the sources, and required little pre-processing. The data from Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center, however, needed a fair amount of processing to turn it into two, separate, usable CSV files, which can be accessed below:

* [Permits Issued in Allegheny County, 2020](pittsburgh_updated_permits_2020.csv)
* [Property Sales in Pittsburgh Since 2013](property_sales_pittsburgh.csv.zip)

The national data will serve as a reference point for the reader to establish that home and renovation prices in Pennsylvania are high, but they're not the highest in the country. By providing benchmark values, the project creates a frame of reference for the reader before getting into real estate and renovation details at the city level.

The data for Pittsburgh is more specific and meant to help the reader form an opinion. Does the reader value homes that are quickly growing in value (thereby providing a better investment) or do they value homes that are perhaps more expensive, but require less work? Separating out information by zip code and neighborhood will help them to make these decisions if they're looking to buy a house. The permitting / renovation information for Pittsburgh will speak to the secondary goal of the project which is to provide a realistic look at housing problems in Pittsburgh, and what renovations of an older home really look like. 

This will equip the reader to make an informed decision when looking at Zillow portfolios and taking the preference quiz in the "What's Next?" Section of the Project. 

## Method & Medium

First and foremost, the method is tailored to the target audience. The target audience for this presentation is young professionals looking to buy a house in Pittsburgh. This makes the assumption that have some prior knowledge about the important factors in buying a home, or they have some level of interest in real estate. Based on this target audience, framing the story is critical ([How to Give A Killer Presentation](https://hbr.org/2013/06/how-to-give-a-killer-presentation)). My plan is to frame the story as a journey: my "bad luck" with home buying in Pittsburgh seems to resonate with people whenever I tell the story in a personal setting because my husband and I were unprepared to deal with the financial undertaking and occasional physical risk associated with buying an old home.
However, our journey has resolved for the better as we've realized the benefits of smart real estate investing. Additionally, we've learned valuable skills about how to renovate a house, particularly an older Pittsburgh house. We want to share our lessons with others, and that will be the center of the story-telling method.

Next, critical to the method is to draw this audience in is to start big (national scale) and go small (Pittsburgh). Pittsburgh has drawn people from all over the country (whether college students or Army officers). By including national benchmarks, potential home-buyers can compare Pittsburgh to other places they've lived. For me, coming from Hawaii, the home values in Pittsburgh are fantastic and very appealing. However, if someone is coming from Oklahoma, home values in Pittsburgh may seem completely unreasonable. Additionally, the overview at each level starts with larger, more general ideas such as average home prices in certain areas and moves to more specific, detailed ideas such as the areas of a home that (if renovated) bring in the most value. This helps to establish initial housing trends before moving into renovation strategies (a concept the reader may not be as familiar with).
