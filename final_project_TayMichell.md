# Navigating the Housing Market in Pittsburgh

Over the next few years, the Artificial Intelligence Integration Center (AI2C) in Pittsburgh will grow from employing 40 Army personnel to 400+.
As Pittsburgh increases in popularity as an AI hub for many corporations, recently graduated students may increasingly look at staying in Pittsburgh long-term.
While renting is typically the first choice of young professionals (particularly in a seller's market), there are significant financial and psychological benefits to having ahome that is your own.
The following overview establishes a data-driven look at the real estate market in Pittsburgh, and what you need to know before investing in a home. 

## Outline
*Summary:*
When my husband and I first moved to Pittsburgh in June of 2020, it was difficult to know which neighborhood to live in and the nuances of home buying in the area. The goal of this project is two-fold: inform about the current real estate trends in Pittsburgh and give home owners and potential home buyers the tools to make informed decisions when it comes to renovations and updates.

The project will be broken down into the following sections:
* National Real Estate
* National Renovations
* Pittsburgh Real Estate
* Pittsburgh Renovations
* What's Next?

Each of the sections are further explained in the Initial Sketches section below.

## Initial Sketches

#### WHAT'S NEXT?

## The Data

The data for the project will come from four main sources, as shown in the table below:

| Topic | National Level | Pittsburgh |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Home Prices | Experien: [Median Home Value by State](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/research/median-home-values-by-state/) | Western PA Regional Data Center: [Allegheny County Property Sale Transactions](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/real-estate-sales) |
| Renovation Prices | Pro Remodeler: [Improvement Spending By State](https://www.proremodeler.com/improvement-spending-state) | Western PA Regional Data Center: [City of Pittsburgh Permit Summary](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-building-permit-summary) |

The national data was copied directly from the sources, and required little pre-processing. The data from Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center, however, needed a fair amount of processing to turn it into two, separate, usable CSV files, which can be accessed below:

* [Permits Issued in Allegheny County, 2020](pittsburgh_updated_permits_2020.csv)
* [Property Sales in Pittsburgh Since 2013](property_sales_pittsburgh.csv.zip)

The national data will serve as a reference point for the reader to establish that home and renovation prices in Pennsylvania are high, but they're not the highest in the country. By providing benchmark values, the project creates a frame of reference for the reader before getting into real estate and renovation details at the city level.

The data for Pittsburgh is more specific and meant to help the reader form an opinion. Does the reader value homes that are quickly growing in value (thereby providing a better investment) or do they value homes that are perhaps more expensive, but require less work? Separating out information by zip code and neighborhood will help them to make these decisions if they're looking to buy a house. The permitting / renovation information for Pittsburgh will speak to the secondary goal of the project which is to provide a realistic look at housing problems in Pittsburgh, and what renovations of an older home really look like. 

This will equip the reader to make an informed decision when looking at Zillow portfolios and taking the preference quiz in the "What's Next?" Section of the Project.
