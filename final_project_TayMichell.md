# Navigating the Housing Market in Pittsburgh

Over the next few years, the Artificial Intelligence Integration Center (AI2C) in Pittsburgh will grow from employing 40 Army personnel to 400+.
As Pittsburgh increases in popularity as an AI hub for many corporations, recently graduated students may increasingly look at staying in Pittsburgh long-term.
While renting is typically the first choice of young professionals (particularly in a seller's market), there are significant financial and psychological benefits to having ahome that is your own.
The following overview establishes a data-driven look at the real estate market in Pittsburgh, and what you need to know before investing in a home. 

## Outline
*Summary:*
When my husband and I first moved to Pittsburgh in June of 2020, it was difficult to know which neighborhood to live in and the nuances of home buying in the area.
The data compiled shows current home buying trends, real estate information specific to the Pittsburgh area, and strategies for reducing costs for first time home-buyers such as DIY renovations.

The project will be broken down into the following sections:
* National Real Estate Trends
* Pittsburgh Real Estate Trends
* Things to look out for when buying a home in Pittsburgh
* Renovation Strategies

## Initial Sketches
