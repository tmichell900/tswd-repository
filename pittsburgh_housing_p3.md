# Pittsburgh Home Buying - Simplified, Part 3

## Changes Since Part II

* Improvements on Introduction. The comparison between the rental property and the property for sale was difficult at first to put directly into Shorthand. I knew that this comparison was a key part to the story, so I went back and forth on different ways to implement it in the presentation. Ultimately, I created side by side photos to be used as an "either / or" exercise during the presentation.
* Use of Zipcode versus Neighborhood. To keep some consistency in the story, I revised much of the presentation to be focused on neighborhoods, rather than zip codes. Unless you live in a particular zip code, it's harder to conceptualize data about a number as opposed to a neighborhood name that you have likely heard before.
* Color Standardization. Although I had the picture of our house as the main picture in Part II, I did some more exploring on Unsplash to find more professional looking photos to use throughout the presentation. I used this to make an updated storyboard as shown below:

* Addition of a Navigation Bar. One of the key realizations during user interviews is that some people (depending on their position in their home-buying journey) find different questions or visualizations throughout the story more appealing. By using a navigation bar at the top, it allows visitors to the website to more quickly navigate to the portion of the story that applies the most to them.
* Call To Action. Finally, I did some more research on the resources people may find interesting at different stages in home buying / renovating. I created a BuzzFeed quiz that allows people to see "which neighbrohood they most identify with" based on some fo the research I did for the presentation (you can take the quiz directly by clicking [here](https://www.buzzfeed.com/aggiethedog2020/pittsburgh-neighborhood-personality-quiz-1129202-dcslqnv19x). There is mortgage, realtor, and financial resources for potential home buyers. Finally, there is a link to the Houzz renovation report for 2021 that served as the inspiration for a good portion of the project.
