# Pittsburgh Home Buying -- Simplified

## You, Too, Can Buy A House In Pittsburgh!

*The story of how our failures can be your success*

## Wireframe of Presentation:

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-top: 56.2500%; padding-bottom: 48px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px 0 rgba(63,69,81,0.16); margin-top: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 8px; will-change: transform;">  
  <iframe loading="lazy" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0; border: none; padding: 0;margin: 0;"    src="https://preview.shorthand.com/jde91MqM55qjXZZW">  </iframe>
</div>

Initial Improvements to Wireframes:
* Clean up references and sources throughout project
* Find more stock photos to replace the pictures of our house

## User Research

To prepare for the user interviews, I developed a short list of questions that addressed three main goals:

Each of the people I interviewed is familiar both with data visualization techniques as well as the topic (home buying), so I was able to tailor the goals to address my main concerns.

The results of the interviews are shown below:

Based on the user interviews, the biggest sustains / takeaways include the economic comparison between renting and buying, 
including personal stories and anecdotes, and showing the renovation data for each zip code / neighborhood.

Below is the list of improvements to make for the final project based on the user interviews:
* Be explicitily clear in the introduction what the presentation will cover
* Create a navigation panel that shows what the presentation will cover and allows easy navigation for the user
* Make the language between "zip code" and "neighborhood" consistent
* Standardize the colors across graph and visualizations
* Improve the colors on individual graphs: make the color more clear on the "Lower Home Values Could Mean Bigger Future Payoffs" viz, and make the colors more reflective of good / bad metrics in the "Who are your neighbors in Pittsburgh?" viz.
* Add in the intro information about how renting wasn't economical for us when we first moved here, and how that made us decide to buy; tie in the closing with the introduction
* Be more explicit about some of the language: "# of permits" isn't intuitively the number of home renovation projects to people unfamiliar with the topic
* Some of the call-outs are not displayed properly (particularly the national snapshot at the beginning); double check all of the formatting to ensure nothing is wrong.

The list above is significantly longer than the original "initial improvements" list I made. Doing the user interviews really helped me to capture improves from an outside perspective, and it gave me a good working list of changes to make on the project.


## Personas and Moodboards

This colorscheme is recycled from Part I, and was created using Canva. Each of the graphs will be revised to better reflect this color scheme so that the presentation seems more professional and put together.
