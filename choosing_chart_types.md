# Choosing Chart Types

The following two exercises come from "Good Charts: Workbook" by Scott Berinato. Each demonstrates how visualizations can be adjusted based on user stories and needs.

## The Surprisingly Adaptable Line Chart - p 95

In this exercise, we're given a line chart that shows how many contacts the registrar office receives via phone, virtual agent, in person, and email.
Each user story requires that you modify the original visualization slightly.

**1. The total number of contacts is important, but it's more important to me that they see how much fo that total each cateogry makes up."**

Because the most important thing was the “parts of a whole” idea over time, I opted for a pie chart that changes over time. 
It provides a cool animation feature that allows you the see the exact moment in time when the virtual agent contact method began to take off, and how much it has grown over time.
