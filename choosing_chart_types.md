# Choosing Chart Types

The following two exercises come from "Good Charts: Workbook" by Scott Berinato. Each demonstrates how visualizations can be adjusted based on user stories and needs.

## The Surprisingly Adaptable Line Chart - p 95

In this exercise, we're given a line chart that shows how many contacts the registrar office receives via phone, virtual agent, in person, and email.
Each user story requires that you modify the original visualization slightly.

**1. The total number of contacts is important, but it's more important to me that they see how much fo that total each cateogry makes up."**

Because the most important thing was the “parts of a whole” idea over time, I opted for a pie chart that changes over time. 
It provides a cool animation feature that allows you the see the exact moment in time when the virtual agent contact method began to take off, and how much it has grown over time.

**2. What matters ot me is to show how much of the total activity is digital over time. Comparing how those two categories are growing against phone and in-person contacts will tell us where we're going and where we should invest.**

Although this chart could have been an area chart, I thought a bar chart highlighting digital growth over phone and in-person better, thereby accomplishing what the decision maker wanted to make an educated decision. In-Person and Phone are shown in the same color to help highlight the growth of digital contacts over time.

**3. "I'm worried they'll get lost in all that trend data. Really we just want them to see snapshots of how the mix is changing.**

In order to capture the snapshots of when one contact medium overtakes the other, I simplified the data to just be a 6-month average. The line chart also helps to show that email and in-person have remained largely unchanged, while phone and virtual contact have been the most volatile.

**4. "I think if we just give them a snapshot view of digital versus nondigital contacts, that's enough to get the point across that digital is growing as a total share."**

In order to just compare two contact methods (digital and non-digital), I opted for a simple bar chart. I re-used the 6-month averages from the previous problem to show the year over year trends, and make the graph simpler to look at.

**5. "I want to see the trend line, but it's really busy with all of the seasonal spikes. I'd like a simpler view into the trend."**

By using a proportion area graph for this user, it's easy to see the trends over time compared to the other contact methods. The number of people who use phones as a contact method is going down, but it's easy to see that comparatively, virtual agent use is increasing.

**6. "When I analyze the data, I see a different trend than digital versus nondigital. I see that email and inperson contacts are flat, but it's really about the rise of the virtual agent against phone contacts."**

For this one, the goals of the user are similar to Question 5, but just to focus on virtual agent compared to phone contacts. It's easy to see that virtual agents is increasing because the yellow area grows over time. I chose an area graph over a line graph because it more deliberately compares the contact methods even though there isn't as much of a sense of the digital agent contact method "shooting up."

## The Great Whiskey Challenge - p 114

I loved this challenge because you get to start with a table and really imagine lots of different ways of viewing the information. The data set is also whimsical and fun to think about. Similar to the Adaptable Line Chart, I also inputted the data into Flourish for repeated use. I didn't focus on colors for the first two questions, but changed the colors for the last two visualizations to be more "whiskey" like. 

**1. “The range of flavors for me was really interesting” **

For this user, I thought it was important to show each aspect of the flavor profile in as much detail as possible. I started with just smoky and richness on the axes, but I added the axes annotations and the different colors for each flavor profile. This would help a whiskey connoisseur because they could just navigate to the section of the scatter plot with the flavor profile they like, or a whiskey newbie because the flavor descriptions at the bottom are detailed.

**2. “I’m fascinated by how regional whiskey is” **

Because this user wanted to see if natural clusters existed, I used the same idea as the previous chart, but I simplified the detail in the flavor profiles. The colors became the different regions, and the user is able to click on the legend to just view the flavor profile of one region at a time.

**3. “Maybe I could do all three? Age, price, and flavor?”

This is the whiskey lover who wants it all. For the project, I've been experimenting with bubble charts in Flourish, and I think they're a really good way of showing multiple variables on the same set of axes. For this visualization, I experimented with the color more to make it more "whiskey" colored, but I kept the flavor profiles on the x and y axes. The size of the bubbles indicates cost, and the color indicates the age. At first glance, it's easy to tell that the oldest, most expensive whiskeys are Rich and a little delicate in terms of flavor profile.

**4. “There are a lot of interesting variables here, but I want to focus on simple comparisons.”**

Because this user wants multiple things communicated in a simple way, the best option is a dashboard. The four variables that stuck out in the questioning that the user wanted to focus on were price, age, smokiness, and region, so I made a four by four visualization concept that could be expanded to include other variables. The region comparisons were communicated using bar charts, while the number comparisons were communicated using scatter plots.
