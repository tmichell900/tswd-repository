# Choosing Chart Types

The following two exercises come from "Good Charts: Workbook" by Scott Berinato. Each demonstrates how visualizations can be adjusted based on user stories and needs.

## The Surprisingly Adaptable Line Chart - p 95

In this exercise, we're given a line chart that shows how many contacts the registrar office receives via phone, virtual agent, in person, and email.
Each user story requires that you modify the original visualization slightly.

**1. The total number of contacts is important, but it's more important to me that they see how much fo that total each cateogry makes up."**

Because the most important thing was the “parts of a whole” idea over time, I opted for a pie chart that changes over time. 
It provides a cool animation feature that allows you the see the exact moment in time when the virtual agent contact method began to take off, and how much it has grown over time.

**2. What matters ot me is to show how much of the total activity is digital over time. Comparing how those two categories are growing against phone and in-person contacts will tell us where we're going and where we should invest.**

Although this chart could have been an area chart, I thought a bar chart highlighting digital growth over phone and in-person better, thereby accomplishing what the decision maker wanted to make an educated decision. In-Person and Phone are shown in the same color to help highlight the growth of digital contacts over time.

**3. "I'm worried they'll get lost in all that trend data. Really we just want them to see snapshots of how the mix is changing.**

In order to capture the snapshots of when one contact medium overtakes the other, I simplified the data to just be a 6-month average. The line chart also helps to show that email and in-person have remained largely unchanged, while phone and virtual contact have been the most volatile.

**4. "I think if we just give them a snapshot view of digital versus nondigital contacts, that's enough to get the point across that digital is growing as a total share."**

In order to just compare two contact methods (digital and non-digital), I opted for a simple bar chart. I re-used the 6-month averages from the previous problem to show the year over year trends, and make the graph simpler to look at.

**5. "I want to see the trend line, but it's really busy with all of the seasonal spikes. I'd like a simpler view into the trend."**

By using a proportion area graph for this user, it's easy to see the trends over time compared to the other contact methods. The number of people who use phones as a contact method is going down, but it's easy to see that comparatively, virtual agent use is increasing.
